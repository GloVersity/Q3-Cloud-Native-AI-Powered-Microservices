# Cloud Native AI Powered Microservices Design, Development, and Deployment

Welcome to the **Cloud Native AI Powered Microservices** repository, organized by **GloVersity (GloProg)**. This repository contains all the work, assignments, and code examples discussed during the **Online Sessions** aimed at helping students strengthen their skills in designing, developing, and deploying AI-powered microservices.

This repository is part of **Quarter 3** of the **Certified Cloud Native Applied Generative AI Engineer** program.

## Overview

The **Cloud Native AI Powered Microservices** sessions focus on building scalable AI-powered APIs using **FastAPI**, **Postgres**, **Kafka**, and **Kong**. You will learn to integrate various GenAI APIs, such as OpenAI Chat Completion APIs, Assistant APIs, and LangChain, while developing these applications using containers and Dev containers. We will also cover deployment using **Docker Compose** locally and **Kubernetes Powered Serverless Container Services** on the cloud.

Additionally, you will learn to integrate **Design Thinking** and **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** in developing AI systems. These methodologies ensure that AI solutions are deeply aligned with user needs and expectations, leading to the development of robust and user-centric applications.

### Instructors:
- **Abdul Qadir Imran** - Lead Instructor, DevOps Engineer (DOE)
- **Abdullah Iqbal** - Co-Instructor, Full Stack Developer (FSD)

### Learning Goals:
- Build scalable AI-powered APIs using **FastAPI** and related technologies
- Understand **Microservices Architecture** and implement it effectively
- Integrate design thinking and BDD to develop user-centric AI solutions
- Deploy applications using **Docker** and **Kubernetes**

Each folder contains:
- **Lecture notes**
- **Source code** used during live sessions
- **Assignments** to practice and improve your skills
